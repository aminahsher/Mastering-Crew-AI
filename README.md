# Mastering-Crew-AI
CrewAI is a free Python tool that helps multiple AI agents work together like a team. Each agent is given a role, goal, and tools to solve complex problems step by step.

**Core Components of CrewAI:**
Agents: Independent AI units with specific roles and goals (e.g., a 'Researcher' gathers information, a 'Writer' creates content). Agents can use tools, make decisions, and work together.

Tasks: Small, clear assignments for agents to complete, contributing to bigger projects.

Tools: Functions or abilities (like searching or analyzing data) that agents use to perform tasks, including CrewAI and LangChain tools.

Crews: Teams of agents working together to complete tasks, following a strategy to ensure collaboration and results.

Flows: Structured workflows for coordinating tasks and crews efficiently, used to build advanced AI automations.

Processes: Like project management, these organize and distribute tasks among agents to ensure smooth execution.
